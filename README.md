# NOVA
Nimble Outgrowth Virtual Assistant: Giving LLMs the ability to write their own tools and actually use them


## Overview üí°

NOVA is a self-evolving, general-purpose AI agent designed to expand its own capabilities through autonomous code generation and problem solving. 

**Key Features:**

*   **Self-Coding Engine:** Generates Python code dynamically to address complex tasks.
*   **Autonomous Problem Solving:**  Identifies problems, formulates solutions, and implements them through self-generated code.
*   **Continuous Evolution:**  Learns from its experiences and refines its codebase for improved performance.
*   **General Purpose Design:** Capable of tackling a wide range of tasks with the right tools

## Requirements
Nova is based on the LM Studio Python SDK, so make sure to have it installed, alongside Qwen 3 models 32b and A3B at q4 quantizations. For that reason it reccomended to have 24gb+ vram. It is pretty easy to edit the code to use less resource intensive models, though tool use is a must. 

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
Load the code in your IDE and hit run. Proper instructions pending.
