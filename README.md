# NOVA
Nimble Outgrowth Virtual Assistant: Giving LLMs the ability to write their own tools and actually use them


## Overview üí°

NOVA is a self-evolving, general-purpose AI agent designed to expand its own capabilities through autonomous code generation and problem solving. It's built on the principle of continuous learning and adaptation, striving to become a more versatile and intelligent assistant through tool use and adaptabliity. Think of it as an early take on emergent intelligence using LLMs.

This project explores the fascinating intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs), self-modification, and autonomous agency. NOVA isn‚Äôt just *running* code; it's *writing* its own to overcome challenges and unlock new functionalities. 

**Key Features:**

*   **Self-Coding Engine:** Generates Python code dynamically to address complex tasks.
*   **Autonomous Problem Solving:**  Identifies problems, formulates solutions, and implements them through self-generated code.
*   **Continuous Evolution:**  Learns from its experiences and refines its codebase for improved performance.
*   **General Purpose Design:** Capable of tackling a wide range of tasks with the right tools
